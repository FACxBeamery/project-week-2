# Project Week 2
By Antonio and Joao.

##  Project Overview
 A basic dashboard with quick viewing information of popular cryptourrency statistics with choices of different coin pairs. We fetch data using the [Binance API](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md).

## Motivation
We wanted to pull data from a third-party API that could give realtime price information about the most popular cryptocurrencies.
